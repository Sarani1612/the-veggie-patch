# The Veggie Patch

As my Milestone Project 3 for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course,
I have built an application where people are able to find and share vegetarian recipes with each other.

The application can be found at ....

## UX
The application is meant to be a platform for people who are interested in vegetarian cooking,
to get inspired and find and share recipes with each other.\
Data for the app is kept in a MongoDB document-based database with two collections.\
The app incorporates the four basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions, and it was created using HTML, Flask, Jinja templating and CSS.

### User stories
1. as a user I want to be able to browse all recipes for inspiration
2. as a user looking for a specific type of recipe, I want to be able to filter on meal type
3. as a user looking to use up some ingredients, I want to be able to perform a search based on ingredients
3. as a user I want an easy overview of required ingredients
4. as a user I want to be able to print out a clean, well-structured copy of the recipe
5. as a user I want to be able to share recipes with other users
6. as a user who previously added a recipe, I want to be able to edit or delete it

### Wireframes
Wireframes for this project were created for [small screens](static/wireframes/small-screens.pdf)
and for [medium and up](static/wireframes/medium-large-screens.pdf). The decision to roll wireframes for medium and large screens into one
was taken when it quickly became clear that they would only have minor differences. Apart from the navigation bar being collapsed on medium-sized screens,
they are largely identical.

Differences between the wireframes and the actual layout are discussed in the [Features](#features) section below.
